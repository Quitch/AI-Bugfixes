# AI Bugfixes

This is the vanilla Planetary Annihilation: Titans AI, updated to work alongside all community AI and faction mods. It also enables your AI to build previously unsupported units. Refer to it as a dependency in your AI mod to avoid having to roll your own solution.

### What It Does

- Adds a check for the personality tag "vanilla" to every AI build condition
- Adds the "vanilla" personality tag to all vanilla difficulty levels
- Adds new unit names to the AI unit map to allow modded AIs to build every unit
- Adds new group names to the AI unit map to allow it to work with faction mods

### What It Doesn't Do

- Modify the behaviour of the vanilla AI in any way
