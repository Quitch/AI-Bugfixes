# AI Bugfixes and Enhancements

The base game AI implementation for Planetary Annihilation: TITANS features a number of flaws, primarily due to the AI failing to keep up with an evolving unit roster over the course of the game's lifespan. This mod aims to fix those issues.

Please note that there are many ways to resolve the issues handled by this mod; while its purpose is bugfixing, the solutions chosen are in accordance with my interpretation of how best to resolve them, without straying away from the AI's current implementation.

## Installation

You should download and install this mod via the Planetary Annihilation: TITANS in-game [Community Mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417396826).

## What It Does

- Prevents hover units getting stuck on islands with land armies or in ponds with naval fleets.
- Ensures Bluehawk Mobile Tactical Missiles are handled as a long-range unit.
- Recognises that the Advanced Naval Factory can be effective even without a naval route.
- Builds the Phoenix Advanced Fighter.
- Builds the Horsefly Advanced Strafer.
- Prevents the inclusion of factories in mobile unit ratio checks.
- Removes unnecessary economy checks from Titan builds.
- Builds the Atlas Titan.
- Builds the Ares Titan.
- Uncaps the Drifter Hover Tank build ratio when there is no land route.
- Prevents the creation of naval fleets consisting of only Barnacle Naval Barges.
- Prevents orbital scouts from getting stuck on gas giants.
- Tries to avoid placing land factories in areas without land routes.
- Builds Metal Extractors using Orbital Fabricators.
- Builds Torpedo Launchers.
- Builds the Stryker Attack Vehicle.

## What It Doesn't Do

- Fix these issues in Galactic War, as this mode cannot load server mods.
