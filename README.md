# AI Bugfixes and Enhancements

The base game AI implementation for Planetary Annihilation: TITANS features a number of flaws, primarily due to the AI failing to keep up with an evolving unit roster over the course of the game's lifespan. This mod aims to fix those issues.

Please note that there are many ways to resovle the issues handled by this mod, so while its purpose is bugfixing, the solutions chosen are in accordance with my interpretation of how best to resolve them.

### What It Does

- Fix issues which impact skirmish and multiplayer and can be resolved through JSON
  - Hover units will not get stuck on islands with land armies or in ponds with naval fleets
  - Bluehawks are handled correctly as a long-range unit
  - Recognises that the Advanced Naval Factory can be effective even without a naval route
  - Recognises that the Basic Vehicle Factory can be effective even without a land route

### What It Doesn't Do

- Fix issues which impact Galactic War as this mode cannot load server mods
